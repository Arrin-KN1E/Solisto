# Boreas
(Temporary placeholder holder text follows:)

Project Solisto is a family of Arduino based APRS telemetry stations developed for KC9JOY for the city of Seymour Indiana, and greater Jackson County Indiana. (Also, at this time is still partially a personal project) 

Naming convention - (Is it cliche to name projects after gods and mythology? Absolutely. I see no good reason not to. Are my descriptions of the definitions of other languages accurate? Likely Not, but you might get the picture.)

Solisto is Esperanto for soloist. Named as such, since these are designed to be solar powered telemetry stations. Also, 'Sol' is latin for sun, so that is a nice bonus. 

Boreas is named after the personification of the north wind in Greek mythology. This telemetry station's primary purpose is to report air, ground, and road temperatures during the winter, so the highway department can more accurately evaluate road conditions.  

Hermes is the messenger of the gods in Greek mythology. This is a mobile APRS messaging and tracking platform. (Primarily intended for testing of telemetry stations.)   

Salus is named after the goddess of sight in Greek mythology. This is an APRS (Or dedicated freq.) commanded SSTV transmitter. For remote location image updates and for conditions where SSTV would be acceptable.   

Theia is named after the Roman goddess of safety and well-being. This is more of the 'generic' stations for specialty applications such as 'Water on road', 'Datalogging', etc.
